# Project Progress Summary & Next Steps

**Last Updated:** May 8, 2025 (End of Day)

## Current Status

The foundational structure and core components are in place. The `AnalysisEngine` has been significantly developed and tested against live Bybit testnet data.

### Accomplishments:

1.  **Project Setup:** Standard Python structure, `requirements.txt`, `.gitignore`, virtual environment.
2.  **Configuration:** `ConfigManager` loading from `config.json` and `.env` operational.
3.  **Logging:** `LoggingService` using `loguru` implemented and functional.
4.  **Data Ingestion:** `DataIngestionModule` successfully fetches OHLCV and market data from Bybit (testnet) asynchronously via `ccxt`, including basic retry logic.
5.  **Analysis Engine (`src/analysis_engine.py`):**
    *   **15m Contextual Analysis:**
        *   `detect_swing_points`: Implemented and tested.
        *   `detect_bos`: Implemented and tested (uses swing points).
        *   `identify_impulse_leg`: Implemented and tested (uses BOS results).
        *   `calculate_fibonacci_levels`: Implemented and tested (uses impulse leg data).
        *   `detect_fvg`: Implemented and tested (can scan within impulse legs or broadly).
        *   `find_poi_confluence`: Implemented and tested. Successfully identifies 15m POIs based on FVG + Fibonacci + BOS Retest confluence criteria and confidence scoring.
    *   **5m Entry Signal Logic:**
        *   `find_5m_entry_signals`: Implemented and tested. This method:
            *   Takes identified 15m POIs.
            *   Fetches corresponding 5m data using `DataIngestionModule`.
            *   Analyzes 5m data (swings, FVGs) using timeframe-specific parameters.
            *   Identifies entries based on **FVG Mitigation** within the 15m POI.
            *   Includes logic for **5m Market Structure Shift (MSS/BOS)** entries (refined from initial version).
            *   Calculates a preliminary **Stop-Loss (SL)** based on the 5m structure related to the entry trigger.
        *   Refactored `detect_swing_points`, `detect_bos`, `detect_fvg` to accept `timeframe_key` for using 5m-specific parameters.
6.  **Testing:** The `if __name__ == '__main__':` block in `analysis_engine.py` has been used iteratively to test each component against live testnet data (fetching up to 500 candles). Pandas `FutureWarning`s addressed where possible (dtype initialization). Test runs confirm POI and 5m entry signal identification.

### Key Files Added/Modified Recently:
*   `src/analysis_engine.py`: Major additions and refinements for FVG, Fib, POI, and 5m entry logic.
*   `config.json`: Added parameters for 5m analysis and POI confluence.
*   `Implementation_Plan_Crypto_Scanner_Bot.md`: Clarified continuous scanning goal.
*   `src/main.py`: Updated `AnalysisEngine` instantiation.

## Immediate Next Steps:

With the core analysis engine capable of identifying 15m POIs and generating 5m entry signals with preliminary SL, the next priority is to operationalize these findings:

1.  **Risk Management Module (`src/risk_management.py` - New Module):**
    *   Implement `calculate_position_size` function.
    *   Inputs: Entry Price, Stop-Loss Price (from 5m signal), Symbol, Fixed Dollar Risk (from config).
    *   Requires fetching/using contract specifications (tick size, lot size, contract value) from `DataIngestionModule`.
    *   Calculates the required position size in base currency (e.g., BTC quantity) or contracts, adhering to exchange minimums/maximums and step sizes.
    *   Handles potential errors (e.g., division by zero, missing contract specs).
    *   *Dependency:* Needs access to `DataIngestionModule` (or cached contract specs). Update `main.py` and `AnalysisEngine` test block to instantiate and potentially pass this module or use its outputs.

2.  **Signal Output & Alerting Module (`src/signal_alerter.py` - New Module):**
    *   Implement `format_signal` function/method.
    *   Inputs: DataFrame row containing the 15m POI and the corresponding 5m entry signal details (including calculated position size from Risk Manager).
    *   Outputs: A formatted string suitable for logging/console output.
    *   (Future) Implement notification logic (Telegram, Discord) based on config flags.
    *   Update `main.py` / main loop to call this when a valid 5m entry signal is found.

3.  **Automated Journaling Module (`src/journaling.py` - New Module):**
    *   Implement `log_trade_signal` function/method.
    *   Inputs: DataFrame row containing the full signal details (15m POI, 5m entry, SL, TP (can be calculated from R:R), position size).
    *   Outputs: Appends the formatted data to a CSV file or inserts into an SQLite DB based on `config.json` settings.
    *   Define the journal schema (column headers).

**Order of Implementation:** Risk Management -> Journaling -> Alerting (as alerting needs the final calculated position size, and journaling should log everything).

## Future Modules (as per Implementation Plan):

*   **Main Scanner Loop (`src/main.py` refinement):** Implement continuous scanning loop (e.g., every 5 mins using `asyncio.sleep` or `APScheduler`), fetch top N symbols, run analysis, trigger journaling/alerting.
*   **Bot-Specific Modules (Future):** Order Execution, State Management.
*   **Refinements:** Improve 5m MSS logic, SL/TP placement, address remaining `FutureWarning`s, add unit tests.
