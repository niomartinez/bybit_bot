# Project Progress Summary & Next Steps

**Last Updated:** May 9, 2025 (End of Day)

## Current Status

The core scanning infrastructure is largely complete, including data fetching, analysis, risk calculation, alerting, and journaling. Integration with state management and order execution for placing entry orders is implemented but requires refinement due to order placement error handling issues. The system is currently configured to run against the **Live Mainnet** (read-only keys recommended for safety until fully tested).

### Accomplishments:

1.  **Project Setup:** Standard Python structure, `requirements.txt`, `.gitignore`, virtual environment.
2.  **Configuration:** `ConfigManager` loading from `config.json` and `.env` operational. Handles testnet, demo, and live mainnet configurations.
3.  **Logging:** `LoggingService` using `loguru` implemented and functional.
4.  **Data Ingestion:** `DataIngestionModule` successfully fetches OHLCV and instrument info (via direct endpoint) from Bybit (live mainnet) asynchronously via `ccxt`. Includes retry logic and specific handling for demo account limitations (bypasses `load_markets`).
5.  **Analysis Engine (`src/analysis_engine.py`):**
    *   Full 15m/5m analysis pipeline implemented (`run_analysis` method).
    *   Detects Swing Points, BOS, Impulse Legs, FVGs, Fibonacci Levels.
    *   Identifies 15m POIs based on confluence criteria.
    *   Identifies 5m entry signals (FVG Mitigation, MSS/BOS) within 15m POIs.
    *   Calculates preliminary Stop-Loss based on 5m structure.
    *   Returns formatted signal data dictionaries.
    *   Addressed various Pandas `FutureWarning`s.
6.  **Risk Management (`src/risk_management.py`):**
    *   `calculate_position_size` function implemented and tested.
    *   Correctly uses contract specifications (tick size, lot size, contract size) fetched via `DataIngestionModule`.
    *   Calculates position size based on fixed dollar risk, adhering to exchange minimums/steps.
    *   Tested successfully against live mainnet (using read-only keys for safety).
7.  **Signal Alerter (`src/signal_alerter.py`):**
    *   Formats signals clearly, including calculated TPs based on R:R.
    *   Adjusts displayed prices based on `tick_size`.
    *   Logs alerts to console and a dedicated signals file (`logs/trade_signals.log`).
    *   Placeholders for Telegram/Discord exist.
8.  **Journaling Module (`src/journaling.py`):**
    *   Supports logging full signal details (including TPs, risk info, POI details) to CSV (`logs/trade_journal.csv`).
    *   Handles file creation and header writing.
    *   Schema includes placeholders for future bot execution details.
9.  **State Manager (`src/state_manager.py`):**
    *   Implemented using SQLite (`logs/bot_state.db` by default).
    *   Creates `tracked_signals` table with indexes.
    *   Generates unique signal IDs based on POI/entry details.
    *   Provides methods to add new pending signals, update status/details, and retrieve signals (by ID, order ID, status, symbol).
    *   Tested successfully.
10. **Order Executor (`src/order_executor.py`):**
    *   Implemented methods to place limit entry, stop loss (Stop), and take profit (Limit) orders using `ccxt`.
    *   Includes formatting helpers for price/quantity based on contract specs.
    *   Includes methods to check and cancel orders.
    *   **Refined error checking for order placement responses** to handle direct Bybit error codes vs standard ccxt success/errors.
11. **Main Loop (`src/main.py`):**
    *   Orchestrates module initialization.
    *   Implements the main periodic scanning loop (`run_scanner`).
    *   Fetches symbols, runs analysis via `AnalysisEngine`.
    *   **Integrates `StateManager`** to check for existing/duplicate signals and concurrency limits.
    *   **Integrates `OrderExecutor`** to attempt placing limit entry orders for new, valid signals.
    *   Adds placed pending orders to `StateManager`.
    *   Logs/Alerts newly placed pending orders.
    *   Handles `KeyboardInterrupt` for graceful shutdown.
    *   Resolved various import and configuration issues for running via `python -m src.main`.

### Key Files Added/Modified Recently:
*   `src/state_manager.py`: New module added.
*   `src/order_executor.py`: New module added and refined.
*   `src/main.py`: Major integration of StateManager, OrderExecutor, and associated logic.
*   `config.json`: Added scanner settings, updated CEX API settings multiple times for testing different environments.
*   `src/data_ingestion.py`: Refactored `get_contract_specs` for direct fetching, updated initialization logic.
*   `src/analysis_engine.py`: Added main `run_analysis` method.

## Immediate Next Steps:

The most recent test run of `src/main.py` still showed a `KeyError: '"retCode"'` when processing signals, despite improvements in `OrderExecutor`. This indicates the `try...except` block in `main.py`'s signal processing loop is still catching an error after a failed order placement attempt returns a non-standard response that `OrderExecutor` didn't fully normalize to `None`.

1.  **Refine `main.py` Signal Processing Error Handling:**
    *   Pinpoint the exact line within the `try...except` block (after the `place_limit_entry_order` call) that fails when `entry_order` is the Bybit error dictionary.
    *   Ensure that if `place_limit_entry_order` returns `None` (which it *should* now do on API error), the subsequent processing steps (enriching, journaling, alerting) are correctly skipped for that specific failed signal.
    *   Add specific logging within the `except` block in `main.py` to show the *value* and *type* of the `entry_order` variable when the failure occurs.

2.  **Implement Order Status Monitoring (`main.py`):**
    *   Add a new section within the main `while True` loop (after processing new signals).
    *   Fetch all signals with status `PENDING_ENTRY` from `StateManager`.
    *   For each pending signal, call `OrderExecutor.check_order_status` using the stored `entry_order_id`.
    *   Handle different statuses returned by `check_order_status`:
        *   `'closed'` (Filled): Update `StateManager` status to `ENTRY_FILLED`, record fill price. **Trigger SL/TP placement.**
        *   `'canceled'`, `'rejected'`, `'expired'`, `'notFound'`: Update `StateManager` status accordingly (e.g., `CANCELLED`, `ERROR`). Log the event.
        *   `'open'`: Keep checking in the next loop. Log status periodically if desired.

3.  **Implement SL/TP Placement (`main.py` / `OrderExecutor`):**
    *   When an entry order is confirmed filled (Step 2):
        *   Retrieve necessary details (symbol, direction, qty, original SL price, TP targets) from the signal data stored in `StateManager`.
        *   Calculate the primary TP price (e.g., based on the first R:R target).
        *   Call `OrderExecutor.place_stop_loss_order`.
        *   Call `OrderExecutor.place_take_profit_order`.
        *   If SL/TP placement is successful, update the signal in `StateManager`: set status to `POSITION_OPEN`, store `sl_order_id` and `tp_order_id`.
        *   Handle potential errors during SL/TP placement (e.g., log critical error, potentially try to close the just-opened position with a market order if SL/TP fails - complex recovery).

## Future Modules/Refinements (as per Implementation Plan):

*   Implement Position/SL/TP Monitoring (`main.py`).
*   Add Telegram/Discord notifications (`SignalAlerter`).
*   Add SQLite support to `JournalingModule`.
*   Refine SL placement logic (e.g., buffer ticks vs percentage).
*   Add more granular error handling in `OrderExecutor`.
*   Address remaining Pandas `FutureWarning`s.
*   Add unit tests.
*   Explore concurrent analysis using `asyncio.gather`.
*   Explore AI enhancements.
