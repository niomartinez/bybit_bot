# Project Progress Summary & Next Steps

**Last Updated:** May 8, 2025

## Current Status

We have successfully set up the foundational structure and core components for the Crypto Futures Trading Scanner. The project is currently configured to run against the Bybit testnet.

### Accomplishments:

1.  **Project Structure:**
    *   Standard Python project layout with `src/` for source code, `logs/` for runtime logs (auto-created by logger), and `venv/` for the virtual environment.
    *   `requirements.txt` generated, and dependencies are installed within the virtual environment.
    *   Comprehensive `.gitignore` file is in place.

2.  **Configuration Management (`config.json`, `.env`, `src/config_manager.py`):**
    *   `config.json`: Centralized configuration for CEX API details (including testnet/mainnet URLs), logging settings, portfolio (coins to scan), strategy parameters (timeframes, swing points, BOS confirmation), risk management placeholders, notification placeholders, and journaling placeholders.
    *   `.env`: Used for storing secrets (API keys). Loaded by `ConfigManager`.
    *   `src/config_manager.py`: `ConfigManager` class loads settings from `config.json` and secrets from `.env`, providing easy access throughout the application. Handles testnet/mainnet URL selection.

3.  **Logging Service (`src/logging_service.py`):**
    *   `LoggingService` class implemented using `loguru`.
    *   Configurable log levels, file rotation, and console/file output via `config.json`.
    *   Provides a global logger instance for use across modules.

4.  **Data Ingestion Module (`src/data_ingestion.py`):**
    *   `DataIngestionModule` class for interacting with the CEX (Bybit via `ccxt`).
    *   Asynchronous initialization (`initialize()`) that loads exchange markets.
    *   `fetch_ohlcv()`: Asynchronously fetches OHLCV data, converts it to a Pandas DataFrame with UTC timestamps and standardized columns, and includes basic retry logic for rate limits.
    *   `get_contract_specs()`: Asynchronously fetches and caches detailed contract/market specifications (tick size, lot size, precision, limits, etc.), crucial for analysis and future order execution.

5.  **Analysis Engine (`src/analysis_engine.py`):**
    *   `AnalysisEngine` class initialized.
    *   `detect_swing_points()`: Implemented to identify swing highs and lows based on configurable lookback periods.
    *   `detect_bos()`: Implemented to identify Break of Structure (BOS) events (bullish and bearish) based on the detected swing points and closing prices, considering confirmation candles from `config.json`.

6.  **Main Application (`src/main.py`):**
    *   Integrates `ConfigManager`, `LoggingService`, `DataIngestionModule`, and (implicitly through tests) `AnalysisEngine`.
    *   Currently performs a test run: initializes the data module, fetches sample OHLCV data for the first configured coin.
    *   Runs asynchronously.

7.  **Testing:**
    *   Each core module (`config_manager.py`, `logging_service.py`, `data_ingestion.py`, `analysis_engine.py`) includes an `if __name__ == '__main__':` block for direct testing of its functionalities.
    *   The application can be run as a module using `python -m src.main`.

### Key Files:
*   `Implementation_Plan_Crypto_Scanner_Bot.md`: Overall project plan.
*   `Trading_Strategy_5m_15m_BOS_FVG_Fib_Confluence.md`: Detailed trading strategy.
*   `config.json`: Main application configuration.
*   `.env`: API secrets (not committed).
*   `src/main.py`: Main application entry point.
*   `src/config_manager.py`: Handles loading configurations.
*   `src/logging_service.py`: Handles application-wide logging.
*   `src/data_ingestion.py`: Handles CEX data fetching.
*   `src/analysis_engine.py`: Houses trading strategy logic.

## Immediate Next Steps for Analysis Engine:

The current focus is to complete the core logic within the `AnalysisEngine` to identify potential trade setups based on the 15m contextual analysis outlined in the strategy.

1.  **Impulse Leg Identification:**
    *   Develop a method to identify the start and end of the impulsive move that caused a confirmed BOS. This will likely use the `bos_src_time` (timestamp of the broken swing point) and the timestamp of the BOS confirmation.
    *   The output should clearly define the high and low of this impulse leg.

2.  **Fair Value Gap (FVG) Identification:**
    *   Implement `detect_fvg(df, impulse_leg_start_time, impulse_leg_end_time)`:
        *   Scans candles, particularly within the identified impulse leg.
        *   Identifies the 3-candle FVG pattern.
        *   Returns details of FVGs (top, bottom, timestamp).

3.  **Fibonacci Retracement Calculation:**
    *   Implement `calculate_fibonacci_levels(impulse_leg_high, impulse_leg_low)`:
        *   Takes the high and low of the identified impulse leg.
        *   Calculates specified Fibonacci retracement levels (e.g., 0.50, 0.618, 0.786 from `config.json`).

4.  **Point of Interest (POI) / Confluence Check:**
    *   Develop logic to combine the outputs:
        *   Check if a 15m FVG aligns with key 15m Fibonacci levels.
        *   Check if this zone is near the retest of the broken 15m structure (BOS level).
        *   Assign a rule-based confidence score as per the implementation plan.

5.  **5m Entry Signal Logic (Initial Placeholder/Structure):**
    *   Once a 15m POI is identified, define the structure for how the 5m chart analysis will be triggered and what it will look for (mitigation of 5m FVG, 5m MSS/BOS). This might initially be a placeholder function.

## Future Modules (as per Implementation Plan):

Once the `AnalysisEngine` can reliably identify 15m POIs:

*   **Risk Management Module:** Calculate position sizing based on $1 fixed risk.
*   **Signal Output & Alerting:** Present identified setups.
*   **Automated Journaling Module:** Log setups and (future) trades.
*   **Bot-Specific Modules (Future):** Order Execution, State Management.
