# Project Progress Summary & Next Steps

**Last Updated:** May 12, 2025

## Current Status

The core scanning infrastructure is largely complete. Order placement for **entry orders is now functional** on the Live Mainnet after resolving a critical `KeyError` and ensuring correct API parameters for Bybit V5. The system now correctly maps internal signal directions ('bullish'/'bearish') to API-compliant 'Buy'/'Sell' and includes the 'category': 'linear' parameter for derivative trades.

The immediate next step is to robustly handle the lifecycle of these placed orders, specifically monitoring for fills and then triggering Stop-Loss (SL) and Take-Profit (TP) order placements. The `OrderExecutor.check_order_status` method has been refactored to use more reliable Bybit V5 endpoints (`fetchOpenOrders`, `fetchClosedOrders`).

### Accomplishments:

1.  **Project Setup:** Standard Python structure, `requirements.txt`, `.gitignore`, virtual environment.
2.  **Configuration:** `ConfigManager` loading from `config.json` and `.env` operational.
3.  **Logging:** `LoggingService` using `loguru` implemented and functional, including `ccxt` verbose mode for deep debugging.
4.  **Data Ingestion:** `DataIngestionModule` successfully fetches OHLCV and instrument info from Bybit.
5.  **Analysis Engine (`src/analysis_engine.py`):**
    *   Full 15m/5m analysis pipeline implemented.
    *   **Corrected signal direction mapping**: Ensures `signal_data['direction']` is "Buy" or "Sell" for API calls.
6.  **Risk Management (`src/risk_management.py`):**
    *   `calculate_position_size` function implemented and tested.
7.  **Signal Alerter (`src/signal_alerter.py`):**
    *   Formats signals and logs them.
8.  **Journaling Module (`src/journaling.py`):**
    *   Supports logging full signal details to CSV.
9.  **State Manager (`src/state_manager.py`):**
    *   Implemented using SQLite, tracks signal lifecycle.
10. **Order Executor (`src/order_executor.py`):**
    *   **Successfully placing limit entry orders:** Resolved `KeyError: '"retCode"'` by:
        *   Ensuring correct `side` parameter ("Buy"/"Sell") is sent to the API.
        *   Explicitly adding `'category': 'linear'` to order parameters for Bybit V5.
    *   **Refactored `check_order_status`**: Now uses `fetchOpenOrders` and `fetchClosedOrders` instead of the limited `fetchOrder` for Bybit V5, improving reliability.
    *   Implemented robust error handling and logging for order placement methods.
11. **Main Loop (`src/main.py`):**
    *   Orchestrates module initialization and the main scanning loop.
    *   Integrates `StateManager` and `OrderExecutor` for placing entry orders.
    *   Identified and resolved the root cause of order placement failures through iterative debugging and use of a minimal test script.

### Key Files Added/Modified Recently:
*   `src/analysis_engine.py`: Corrected `direction` mapping in `run_analysis`.
*   `src/order_executor.py`: Major refinements to error handling, added `category` to params, refactored `check_order_status`.
*   `src/main.py`: Iterative debugging of the signal processing and order placement loop.
*   `minimal_order_test.py`: Created and used for isolated `ccxt` testing, confirming API key validity and parameter requirements. (This file can be kept for future isolated tests or removed).
*   `src/data_ingestion.py`: Enabled `verbose` mode for `ccxt` during debugging.

## Debugging Journey Summary:

The primary challenge was a persistent `KeyError: '"retCode"'` occurring when `main.py` called `order_executor.place_limit_entry_order`. Through verbose `ccxt` logging and a minimal test script, we discovered:
1.  The `minimal_order_test.py` script *could* successfully place orders when correct parameters (including `'category': 'linear'`) were used.
2.  The main application was sending an incorrect `"side"` parameter (e.g., `"Bullish"` instead of `"Buy"`).
3.  Bybit responded with `{"retCode":10001,"retMsg":"Side invalid"}`.
4.  `ccxt` (version used or its interaction with `aiohttp`) did not gracefully convert this specific Bybit error into a standard `ccxt.InvalidOrder` or `ccxt.ExchangeError` that `OrderExecutor`'s internal `try...except` blocks were initially set up to catch. Instead, it seems to have raised the `KeyError: '"retCode"'` from within the `await exchange.create_order()` call itself, which was then caught by the calling function in `main.py`.

Fixing the `side` parameter in `AnalysisEngine` and ensuring `category: 'linear'` in `OrderExecutor` resolved the Bybit API error, which in turn stopped `ccxt` from raising the `KeyError`.

## Immediate Next Steps:

With entry order placement now working and `check_order_status` improved, the immediate focus is to complete the order lifecycle management as outlined in the "Implement Order Status Monitoring" and "Implement SL/TP Placement" phases of the `Implementation_Plan_Crypto_Scanner_Bot.md`.

1.  **Integrate Enhanced Order Status Monitoring (`main.py`):**
    *   In the "Order Status Monitoring" section of `main.py`'s loop:
        *   Utilize the refactored `OrderExecutor.check_order_status`.
        *   Correctly interpret the returned status (e.g., `open`, `closed` (for filled), `canceled`, `notFoundByPreferredMethods`).
        *   Update `StateManager` reliably:
            *   If `closed` (filled): Change status to `ENTRY_FILLED`. Record fill price (`averagePrice`) and filled quantity (`filled`) from the order details. **Crucially, trigger SL/TP placement.**
            *   If `canceled`, `rejected`, `expired`, or `notFoundByPreferredMethods` (after sufficient checks/time): Update `StateManager` status appropriately (e.g., `CANCELLED`, `REJECTED`, `ERROR_MONITORING`). Log the event.
            *   If `open`: Keep monitoring in the next loop. Log status periodically.
        *   Remove the old logic that marked orders as `UNKNOWN_API_STATUS` due to `fetchOrder` limitations.

2.  **Implement SL/TP Placement Logic (`main.py` / `OrderExecutor`):**
    *   Create a new async function in `main.py` (e.g., `place_sl_tp_orders_for_signal`) that is called when an entry order's status becomes `ENTRY_FILLED`.
    *   This function will:
        *   Retrieve necessary details (symbol, direction, filled quantity, actual entry price, original SL price from `signal_data`) from `StateManager` and the filled order details.
        *   Calculate the primary TP price based on the strategy (e.g., fixed R:R from `config.json` using the *actual fill price* and original SL). This might involve fetching contract specs again via `RiskManagementModule` if needed for tick size adjustments for the TP price.
        *   Call `OrderExecutor.place_stop_loss_order` with the correct parameters (original SL price, filled quantity).
        *   Call `OrderExecutor.place_take_profit_order` (for the primary TP).
        *   If SL and TP orders are successfully placed, update the signal's status in `StateManager` to `POSITION_OPEN`, storing the `sl_order_id` and `tp_order_id`.
        *   Implement robust error handling for SL/TP placement failures (e.g., log critical error, update signal status to reflect partial failure like `SL_FAILED_TP_OKAY` or `POSITION_OPEN_NO_SLTP`). Alert user for manual intervention if critical.

## Future Modules/Refinements (Post SL/TP):

*   Implement Position/SL/TP Monitoring (`main.py` loop for `POSITION_OPEN` signals).
*   Add Telegram/Discord notifications (`SignalAlerter`).
*   Refine SL placement logic (e.g., buffer ticks vs percentage, ATR-based).
*   Address remaining Pandas `FutureWarning`s (low priority).
*   Add unit tests.
