```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### 1. "Google Sheets credentials file not found"
- Ensure `credentials.json` is in the bot's root directory
- Check the file path in `config.json`

#### 2. "Google authentication error"
- Verify the service account has access to the spreadsheet
- Check that the Google Sheets API is enabled
- Ensure the credentials file is valid JSON

#### 3. "Spreadsheet not found"
- Verify the spreadsheet ID in `config.json`
- Ensure the service account has "Editor" permissions
- Check that the spreadsheet exists and is accessible

#### 4. "Worksheet not found"
- The bot will automatically create the worksheet if it doesn't exist
- Ensure the worksheet name in `config.json` matches exactly

### Debug Mode

To enable detailed logging for Google Sheets operations:

1. Set logging level to DEBUG in `config.json`:
   ```json
   {
     "logging": {
       "level": "DEBUG"
     }
   }
   ```

2. Check logs for Google Sheets related messages:
   ```bash
   tail -f logs/trading_bot.log | grep -E "(üìù|üìä|Google Sheets)"
   ```

## Security Considerations

1. **Credentials Protection**: Keep `credentials.json` secure and never commit it to version control
2. **Service Account Permissions**: Only grant necessary permissions to the service account
3. **Spreadsheet Access**: Limit spreadsheet sharing to essential users only
4. **Regular Backups**: Use the backup endpoint regularly to create local copies

## Optional: Disable Google Sheets

If you want to disable Google Sheets integration:

```json
{
  "google_sheets": {
    "enabled": false
  }
}
```

The bot will continue to function normally without trade journaling.

## Advanced Configuration

### Custom Worksheet Name
```json
{
  "google_sheets": {
    "worksheet_name": "My Custom Journal"
  }
}
```

### Alternative Credentials Location
```json
{
  "google_sheets": {
    "credentials_file": "path/to/my/credentials.json"
  }
}
```

## Data Analysis

Once your trades are logged to Google Sheets, you can:

1. **Create Charts**: Use Google Sheets' built-in charting tools
2. **Pivot Tables**: Analyze performance by strategy, symbol, or time period
3. **Conditional Formatting**: Highlight winning/losing trades
4. **Export Data**: Download as CSV/Excel for external analysis
5. **Share Reports**: Create shareable performance reports

## Support

If you encounter issues with Google Sheets integration:

1. Check the troubleshooting section above
